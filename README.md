# SmallCodingProjects

These are the small coding projects that I've worked on.

The reason why these projects are here and not in their own repository is because these problems took maximum a couple hours to code and I never intended for them to be standalone projects (like klabber, for example).

-------------

- FizzBuzz (Java)

I saw this project idea get thrown around quite often and I thought that it'd be a fun piece of code to try to create. Overall, it wasn't as challenging as I'd hoped it to be - I guess the challenge was the order in which comparisons are executed in as well as making the program as efficient as possible.


- Circular array stack (Java)

I studied circular array stacks as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms module in year 1 and I wanted to have a go at coding it to see if I could do it correctly.


- Autoclicker (Python)

I needed an autoclicker for one of my video games and instead of getting a program from the internet, I might as well attempt to make my own.
